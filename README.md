Xilinx LUT editing functions
================
This repository contains the source code to read and edit the LUT contents of CLBs on the Virtex 5. Other architectures can probably be supported with minimal changes.

This serves as a replacement for the XHwIcap_GetClbBits and XHwIcap_SetClbBits functions provided by Xilinx.
